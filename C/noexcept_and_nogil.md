The noexcept and nogil keywords in Cython serve specific purposes related to exception handling and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python. Here's a breakdown of why they are not included in the C header file (criterion.h):
Explanation of noexcept and nogil
## noexcept:
In C++, the noexcept specifier indicates that a function does not throw exceptions. This is a compile-time guarantee that can help with optimizations and error handling.
In C, there is no direct equivalent to noexcept. C does not have a built-in exception handling mechanism like C++, so all functions in C are assumed to not throw exceptions by default. Therefore, you do not need to specify noexcept in a C header file.
## nogil:
In Cython, nogil indicates that the function can be executed without holding the GIL, allowing other threads to run Python code concurrently. This is particularly important for performance in multi-threaded applications.
In C, there is no concept of the GIL, as C does not have built-in support for Python's threading model. The GIL is specific to the Python interpreter, and C code does not need to concern itself with it. Thus, you do not include nogil in a C header file.
## Conclusion
Since noexcept and nogil are specific to Cython and its interaction with Python, they are not relevant in a pure C context. Therefore, when translating the Cython code to C, you can omit these keywords. The function declarations in the C header file are sufficient for defining the interface without needing to specify exception handling or GIL-related concerns.
If you need to document that certain functions are thread-safe or do not throw exceptions, you can do so in comments, but it is not necessary in the function signatures themselves.
