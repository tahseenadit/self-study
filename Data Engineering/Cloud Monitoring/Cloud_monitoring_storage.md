Google Cloud Monitoring does not directly store its data in Bigtable. Instead, Google Cloud Monitoring primarily relies on Google's distributed storage and processing infrastructure, including Google Cloud's Time Series Database (TSDB) and other internal systems, to collect, store, and analyze monitoring data.

1. **Time Series Database (TSDB)**: Google Cloud Monitoring uses a distributed time series database to store monitoring data collected from various Google Cloud services and resources. This database is optimized for storing and querying time series data, such as metrics and monitoring statistics, at scale. While Google does not explicitly disclose the underlying storage technology, it is likely a custom-built solution tailored for high availability, scalability, and performance.

2. **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**: Google Cloud Monitoring may also leverage Google Cloud Storage for storing additional monitoring data, such as logs, traces, and other telemetry data generated by applications running on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Google Cloud Storage provides scalable, durable, and cost-effective object storage for unstructured data.

3. **BigQuery**: Although not directly used for storing monitoring data, Google Cloud Monitoring offers integration with BigQuery, Google's fully managed data warehouse and analytics platform. Users can export monitoring data from Google Cloud Monitoring to BigQuery for further analysis, visualization, and reporting. BigQuery is particularly useful for performing ad-hoc analytics, complex queries, and data exploration on large datasets.

While Google Cloud Monitoring does not utilize Bigtable for storing monitoring data, Bigtable is another managed NoSQL database service offered by Google Cloud Platform. Bigtable is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency workloads and is commonly used for real-time data processing, analytics, and time-series data storage in various use cases, including IoT, financial services, and advertising technology.
