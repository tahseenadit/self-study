Here are the key points to consider and steps you can take:

**Understanding `logging.info()` and Cloud Run Logs:**

- **`logging.info()`:** This method logs a message at the "INFO" level. It accepts the message as the first argument and optional arguments for additional context.
- **Cloud Run Logs:** These logs capture the execution of your Cloud Run container and are accessible through the Cloud Console or Logs Explorer.

**Potential Reasons for Missing Extra Information:**

- **Logging Level:** Cloud Run logs by default only include messages logged at the "WARNING" level or higher. If your `logging.basicConfig()` is configured with a higher level than "INFO", the extra info won't be included.
- **Handler Configuration:** The handler configured for your logger might not be set up to capture the extra information. Common handlers like `StreamHandler` (logs to console) or `FileHandler` (logs to a file) do not capture extra information by default.
- **Formatter Configuration:** The formatter used in your handler might not be configured to include the extra information in the log output.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check Logging Level:**
   - Use `logging.getLogger().getEffectiveLevel()` to get the effective level.
   - Set it to `logging.INFO` or lower if needed: `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)`.

2. **Inspect Handler Configuration:**
   - Check your handler configuration to see if it's capturing extra information.
   - For `StreamHandler` or `FileHandler`, use a formatter that supports extra information.

3. **Configure Formatter:**
   - Use a formatter like `logging.Formatter("%(message)s %(levelname)s %(asctime)s %(extra)s")` to include extra information.

4. **Test and Verify:**
   - Rerun your code and check the Cloud Run logs for the extra information.

**Additional Tips:**

- Consider using a structured logging library like `structlog` for easier and more efficient logging with extra information.
- Refer to the official documentation for more advanced logging configuration options in Python and Cloud Run.

By following these steps and carefully considering the potential causes, you should be able to successfully include the extra information in your Cloud Run logs and gain valuable insights into your application's behavior.

By default, cloud run only captures messages logged at the "WARNING" level or higher, which means messages logged with `logging.INFO` and even lower levels like `DEBUG` won't be included in the logs you see.

Here's a breakdown of the standard logging levels and their order of severity:

**Higher than WARNING:**

- **ERROR:** Indicates an error that prevents the application from functioning as intended.
- **CRITICAL:** Indicates a critical error that could lead to system failure.
- **FATAL:** Indicates a fatal error that causes the application to terminate.

**Same as WARNING:**

- **WARNING:** Indicates an unexpected situation that might cause problems but doesn't necessarily prevent the application from working.

**Lower than WARNING:**

- **INFO:** Provides general informational messages about the application's operation.
- **DEBUG:** Provides detailed debugging information for troubleshooting issues.
- **TRACE:** Provides very detailed information for tracing the program's execution flow.

So, if you want to see the extra information you're logging with `logging.info()`, you'll need to change the logging level in your code to be lower than "WARNING". You can do this by using `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` in your code, which sets the effective level to "INFO" and captures all messages at that level and below.

Remember that lowering the logging level will also include more verbose information in your logs, which can be helpful for debugging but might be overwhelming if you're not actively troubleshooting. It's generally recommended to set the logging level to the most appropriate level for your needs, balancing the need for information with the desire for a clean and concise log.

The handler configured for your logger might not be set up to capture the extra information. Common handlers like StreamHandler (logs to console) or FileHandler (logs to a file) do not capture extra information by default. What handler does cloud run console has by default ?

Cloud Run logs by default use a **Cloud Logging Handler** that captures all log messages, including the extra information in `logging.info()` messages. This handler is specifically designed for Cloud Run and integrates seamlessly with the Cloud Logging platform, allowing you to view and manage logs efficiently.

While common handlers like `StreamHandler` and `FileHandler` might not capture extra information by default, they can be configured to do so using specific formatters. However, in the context of Cloud Run, you don't need to worry about configuring handlers as the built-in Cloud Logging Handler handles everything for you.

Here's a breakdown of the logging setup in Cloud Run:

- **Logging Library:** Cloud Run applications typically use the standard Python logging library.
- **Logging Level:** By default, Cloud Run applications log messages at the "WARNING" level and higher. You can adjust this level using `logging.basicConfig(level=...)` in your code.
- **Handler:** Cloud Run uses a **Cloud Logging Handler** that automatically sends logs to Cloud Logging. You don't need to configure this handler manually.
- **Formatter:** Cloud Run logs use a formatter that includes the message, level, timestamp, and other information, including the extra data you provide with `logging.info()`.

If you're still not seeing the extra information in your Cloud Run logs, double-check the following:

- **Logging Level:** Ensure your application's logging level is set to "INFO" or lower.
- **Cloud Logging Configuration:** Verify that your Cloud Logging project and bucket are configured correctly. You can access and manage these settings in the Cloud Console or through the gcloud command-line tool.

By following these points and understanding the default setup, you should be able to access the complete information you log with `logging.info()`, including the extra data, in your Cloud Run logs.


**1. Check Logging Level:**

- First, make sure your application's logging level is set to "INFO" or lower. By default, Cloud Run only logs messages at the "WARNING" level and higher. You can check your code for lines like `logging.basicConfig(level=...)`. If you don't find it, add this line early in your code with the desired level:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

**2. Verify Cloud Logging Settings:**

- Cloud Run automatically sends logs to a Cloud Logging bucket in your project. You don't need to create the bucket manually, but you do need to verify that it's accessible:

  - **In the Cloud Console:**
    1. Go to the **Cloud Logging** page.
    2. Find your project in the list.
    3. Look for the bucket associated with your Cloud Run service. By default, it's named after your service and has a unique identifier.
    4. Ensure the bucket's status is "Enabled" and its access settings allow your Cloud Run service to write logs.

  - **Using `gcloud` command-line:**
    1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
    2. Use the `gcloud logging buckets list` command to list your project's Cloud Logging buckets.
    3. Identify the bucket for your Cloud Run service (name usually starts with your service name followed by a unique identifier).
    4. Check the bucket's access settings with `gcloud logging buckets get-iam-policy $BUCKET_NAME`. Ensure your Cloud Run service account has write permissions.

**3. Review Handler and Formatter (Optional):**

- While Cloud Run uses a Cloud Logging Handler by default, checking its configuration and the formatter can provide additional insight. You can find this information in your application's logging configuration (if any). If you're unsure, consulting with a developer familiar with your application's code will be helpful.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

- If you've followed these steps and still don't see the extra information, double-check your code for typos or incorrect configuration.
- You can temporarily set the logging level even lower (e.g., `logging.DEBUG`) to see if the information appears, then adjust it back to "INFO" later.
- Consider using a structured logging library like `structlog` for easier and more efficient logging with extra information.

Remember, if you're using a managed service like Cloud Run, some configurations might be handled automatically or have limited manual control. In such cases, referring to the specific documentation for your service is crucial for understanding the available logging options and limitations.

When Cloud Run automatically sends logs to a Cloud Logging bucket, writing those logs does incur costs. Here's a breakdown of the relevant costs:

**Cloud Logging Costs:**

* **Ingest charge:** There's a one-time charge of $0.50 per GiB for each log entry written to a Cloud Logging bucket. This includes storage for the first 30 days.
* **Retention charge:** After the initial 30 days, you are charged $0.01 per GiB per month for each log entry retained. This cost depends on how long you choose to keep your logs.
* **Log routing:** If you choose to route your logs to other destinations like BigQuery or Cloud Storage, you will incur additional charges for those services.

**Cloud Run Costs:**

* **Compute resources:** Cloud Run charges you for the compute resources used by your container, billed per second with a 100ms rounding. This cost is separate from logging costs.

**Free Tier:**

* Both Cloud Logging and Cloud Run offer a free tier that covers a limited amount of usage. This is generally enough for small applications or development purposes.

**Cost Optimization Tips:**

* **Filter logs:** Only send the logs you need to Cloud Logging. You can filter logs based on severity, log name, or other criteria.
* **Delete old logs:** Regularly delete logs that you no longer need. This will reduce your retention costs.
* **Compress logs:** Compressing logs before sending them to Cloud Logging can reduce storage costs.
* **Utilize the free tier:** If you have a small application, the free tier of Cloud Logging and Cloud Run might be sufficient for your needs.
