Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that extends the capabilities of traditional data storage formats like **Parquet** by introducing a **transaction log** to enable **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** properties, especially on top of cloud object stores like **Amazon S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, or **Google Cloud Storage**. Here's a breakdown of what this means:

### 1. **Parquet Files as the Base Data Format**:
   - **Parquet** is a columnar storage format often used for storing large datasets in a highly compressed and efficient way.
   - In cloud-based data lakes (like S3 or similar storage), data is often stored in Parquet format, which works well for analytics because of its high performance and small storage footprint.
   - However, cloud object stores like S3 are essentially **eventual-consistent**, which means that they lack strong consistency guarantees and transaction support.

### 2. **ACID Capabilities**:
   - **ACID properties** are crucial for managing large datasets reliably, especially in environments where multiple users or processes might be reading from or writing to the data concurrently:
     - **Atomicity**: Operations (such as inserts, updates, or deletes) are either fully completed or not done at all.
     - **Consistency**: The data remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
     - **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions are executed as if they were running serially, preventing interference.
     - **Durability**: Once a transaction is committed, the results are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.

   Traditional data lakes (without Delta Lake) using formats like Parquet alone lack these ACID properties.

### 3. **Transaction Log**:
   - **Delta Lake** adds a **transaction log** layer on top of Parquet files. This transaction log is essentially a series of metadata files that keep track of every change made to the data in a sequential and atomic fashion.
   - The transaction log records operations such as:
     - Adding new data files (e.g., appending new records).
     - Deleting or updating specific records.
     - Schema changes.
   - The log allows Delta Lake to track the version history of the dataset and manage concurrent reads and writes in a consistent way, which is not possible with raw Parquet files on their own.

### 4. **Cloud Object Stores (like S3)**:
   - Cloud object stores like **Amazon S3** are great for storing large volumes of data, but they do not inherently support the ACID guarantees that databases or file systems typically provide.
   - Object stores are **eventually consistent**, meaning that after an update or deletion, it may take time for all clients to see the change.
   - By using the transaction log, Delta Lake bridges this gap by providing **strong consistency** and transactional capabilities on top of these cloud storage systems, ensuring that the state of the data is correct and reliable.

### 5. **ACID Transactions on Cloud Object Stores**:
   - With Delta Lake, when a new operation (like an update or delete) occurs, it's logged in the transaction log. Only once the operation is successfully logged will it be considered committed.
   - This ensures that even though cloud object stores are eventually consistent, Delta Lake can provide a **consistent view of the data** and ensure that all changes are properly committed or rolled back if something goes wrong.

### Benefits of Delta Lake on S3 (or similar):
- **Data Versioning**: Delta Lake allows you to time-travel and query older versions of the data, which is useful for auditing and debugging.
- **Schema Evolution**: Delta Lake handles schema changes gracefully, allowing for schema evolution without corrupting existing data.
- **Efficient Reads/Writes**: By leveraging the transaction log, Delta Lake optimizes reading and writing, making it possible to perform updates, inserts, and deletes on cloud data lakes efficiently.
- **Concurrent Operations**: Delta Lake handles multiple users or jobs accessing and modifying the same data without leading to data corruption, something object stores alone cannot handle reliably.

### Summary:
Delta Lake extends Parquet by adding a **transaction log** that provides **ACID properties** on top of cloud storage systems like Amazon S3. This ensures that the data in the lake is consistent, supports transactions, and can handle concurrent operations, addressing the limitations of traditional cloud object storage, which does not natively support such capabilities.

When you add data to a Parquet file, **the existing Parquet file is not modified directly**. Instead, a **new Parquet file** is created, and the old file remains untouched. Here's how it typically works:

### 1. **Immutability of Parquet Files**:
   - Parquet files are **immutable**, meaning once they are written, they cannot be modified or updated in place.
   - This is due to how Parquet is designed as a columnar storage format optimized for read performance. Direct modifications would break its internal structure, such as metadata, column statistics, and file alignment.
   - Therefore, when data needs to be appended or updated, a new file is created instead of modifying the existing file.

### 2. **Appending Data**:
   - When you append new data, a new Parquet file is written that contains the additional records.
   - The new data is **not merged** with the old Parquet file. Instead, the system simply adds a new Parquet file with the appended data to the storage (e.g., a new file in the same directory or folder in a data lake).

### 3. **File Management**:
   - Over time, if appending happens frequently, you may end up with many Parquet files in your storage, where each file contains a subset of the full dataset (e.g., partitioned by time or batch).
   - Itâ€™s common to perform a **compaction** operation periodically, which merges several small Parquet files into larger ones to optimize for read performance. However, this still involves writing new Parquet files and does not alter the original ones.

### 4. **Updating/Deleting Data**:
   - Similar to appending, when you need to update or delete data in a Parquet file, the original file is **not updated directly**.
   - Instead, the system creates new Parquet files that reflect the updated or deleted records, and then the metadata (or index) is updated to point to the new files. The old Parquet files may be marked as obsolete or eventually deleted.

### 5. **Delta Lake and Transactional Systems**:
   - Systems like **Delta Lake** or **Apache Hudi** handle these changes by using a **transaction log**. They maintain the immutability of Parquet files by keeping track of which files are currently valid and which have been superseded by new files.
   - When you append, update, or delete records in Delta Lake, it creates new Parquet files reflecting the changes and updates the transaction log to mark old files as obsolete.
   - The old files are not immediately deleted, but they may eventually be cleaned up by **garbage collection** processes.

### Example Workflow:
- You have a Parquet file with records from January.
- If you add new records for February, instead of appending them to the January Parquet file:
  - A new Parquet file is created for February's data.
  - Both files coexist in storage.
  - The system (e.g., Delta Lake or the file index) manages which files to read for a full dataset view.

In summary, when data is added to a Parquet-based system, **new files are created** rather than modifying the existing Parquet files. These files remain immutable, and systems like Delta Lake manage them by using metadata and transaction logs, eventually cleaning up old files if necessary.
