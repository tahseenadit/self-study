The choice between BigQuery and Cloud SQL depends on your specific needs:

For large-scale data analytics and complex queries, BigQuery is the preferred option.\
For transactional workloads and real-time data access, Cloud SQL is a better fit.

A **transactional workload** refers to a set of operations performed on a database that **maintain data consistency and integrity**. These operations typically involve **reading, modifying, and deleting data** within a database, and they are often used in **real-time applications** that require frequent updates and access to the latest information.

Here are some key characteristics of transactional workloads:

* **ACID properties:** Transactions adhere to the principles of **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID)**. This ensures that data remains consistent and reliable even in case of failures or errors.\
* **Short duration:** Individual transactions are typically **completed quickly**, often within milliseconds or seconds, to maintain responsiveness and performance in real-time applications.\
* **High concurrency:** Multiple transactions might occur **simultaneously**, requiring the database to manage concurrent access and prevent conflicts between them.\
* **Focus on individual records:** Transactions often involve **inserting, updating, or deleting specific records** within a database table, rather than manipulating large datasets as a whole.

**Examples of applications that generate transactional workloads:**

* **E-commerce platforms:** Processing customer orders, updating inventory levels, and managing user accounts.\
* **Banking systems:** Recording financial transactions, updating account balances, and verifying user credentials.\
* **Social media platforms:** Posting content, interacting with other users, and managing user profiles.\
* **Airline reservation systems:** Booking flights, managing passenger information, and updating seat availability.

# Real-time actions

Imagine new data is coming to the storage and whenever new data is coming, your storage system can identify that and triggers a job. Cloud SQL can do that. It is not only about making sure that data is available in real-time (By better streaming capability) and real-time processing (Executing queries on newly available data). But it is also important to react instantly i.e trigger a job when new data is available. Cloud SQL provides functionality to react instantly but it needs support from. cloud function or other services for processing them. On the other hand, BigQuery can process but needs the help of cloud workflow or other services to react in real-time.

# Partitioning and Materialized Views

While these features can offer performance benefits, their impact depends on various factors like query complexity, data size, and access patterns. While both platforms offer these features, the performance improvements can vary significantly:

**BigQuery:** Due to its inherent architecture and tight integration, BigQuery can potentially achieve greater performance gains with partitioning and materialized views, especially for large datasets and complex queries.

**Cloud SQL:** While offering benefits, Cloud SQL's performance improvements with these features might be more limited, particularly for large-scale scenarios. However, for smaller datasets and specific query patterns, Cloud SQL with partitioning and materialized views can still be a viable and cost-effective option.

- Relational Database Roots: Cloud SQL, being a relational database, might not be as optimized for partitioning and materialized views as BigQuery, which is specifically designed for large-scale analytics.

- Overhead and Management: Implementing and maintaining partitioning and materialized views in Cloud SQL can introduce additional overhead compared to BigQuery's native integration.

- Limited Parallelization: Cloud SQL's parallelization capabilities might be less extensive compared to BigQuery, potentially hindering performance gains for complex queries on large datasets, even with partitioning and materialized views.

For **smaller datasets, specific query patterns, and a focus on predictable pricing**, Cloud SQL with careful implementation of partitioning and materialized views can be a cost-effective option.

# Use Cases

Imagine you are inserting data 100 times in a day. Would you cold start your resources 100 times for that ? No, so bigquery is not an option here. You would just cold start your resources once and then for the time period when your data gets inserted 100 times, you keep your resources on even if they remain idle for some time. So, you go with Cloud SQL. 

Now, imagine you are analysing 1 million data. Your analysis includes executing multiple complex queries one after the other. On top of that, your data is globally distributed. You need automatic provision of resources based on the complexity of each of your queries without any limitation, you need parallel processing power for super fast analysis and results, you need automatic management of networking for minimal latency. You go with BigQuery, not Cloud SQL.
