If I deploy a bucket using terraform and then create a new object inside that bucket using terraform like below:

```
resource "google_storage_bucket_object" "picture" {
  name   = "butterfly01"
  source = "/images/nature/garden-tiger-moth.jpg"
  bucket = "image-store"
}
```

Then manually upload another object in that same bucket, then later want to destroy all resources using `terraform destroy`, will that work smoothly ?

In this scenario, here's what happens when you use `terraform destroy` after manually uploading an additional object to the bucket:

1. **Terraform-Managed Resources**:
   - Terraform will track and manage the `google_storage_bucket_object` resource for the specific object you defined in the configuration (`butterfly01`).
   - The state file includes this object and the bucket, so Terraform knows that these resources are part of the infrastructure it should manage.

2. **Manually Uploaded Object**:
   - The manually uploaded object is not tracked by Terraform since it wasn't created through your Terraform configuration.
   - This object is not included in the Terraform state file, so Terraform is unaware of its existence.

3. **`terraform destroy` Behavior**:
   - When you run `terraform destroy`, Terraform will delete both the bucket and the `butterfly01` object as they are managed resources.
   - Since most cloud storage services delete all contents within a bucket when the bucket itself is deleted, the manually uploaded object will also be removed along with the bucket, even though Terraform doesnâ€™t explicitly track it.

### Summary
The `terraform destroy` command will work smoothly in this scenario. It will delete the bucket (and everything inside it) along with any Terraform-managed objects within that bucket. However, keep in mind that the manually uploaded object will also be deleted since the bucket itself is being removed. 

**Tip**: If you want to preserve manually uploaded objects, consider defining bucket lifecycle rules instead of relying on `terraform destroy` if you often need to manage both manually and Terraform-managed files.
