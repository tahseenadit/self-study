Suppose there is a .csv file. Will you upload it in cloud storage or create a table for it in bigquery ?

# Workload Requirements
**Does the user download the file as a whole in his editor like databricks notebook?**

If so, then the user probably downloads other data and create dataframes and then perform operations.

**Does the user directly query the data using sql?**

If so, then probably the user won't access the csv fle as a whole but would be interested to have the data from the csv file as a table that can be queried directly using sql.

# Permission requirements
**Does the user need file-level access control?**
**What is the access granularity that you need to implement?**

# Performance requirements
- Frequent read and write
- Frequent read and less write
- Less read and frequent write
- less read and less write

While answering the above questions, consider the volume of the data.
- Buffer or queuing technology of the cloud storage or bigquery
- Caching mechanism
- Retention policy
- Throughput bandwidth
- Scaling
- Handling parallel requests

Cloud Storage (e.g., Google Cloud Storage) and BigQuery serve distinct purposes but can overlap in data processing pipelines. Here's how they align with the performance requirements and considerations mentioned:

---

### **1. Frequent Read and Write**
**Characteristics:**
- High volume of data reads and writes, requiring low latency and high throughput.
- Use cases: Real-time data processing, event streaming, transactional data logging.

#### **Cloud Storage:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** Can integrate with queuing systems (e.g., Pub/Sub) for real-time ingestion.
- **Caching:** Relies on external caching mechanisms like Cloud CDN or in-memory caches (e.g., Redis) for frequent reads.
- **Retention Policy:** Configurable; set based on lifecycle management rules for temporary or permanent data.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** High, especially for parallel uploads and downloads.
- **Scaling:** Automatically scales for storage needs and parallel I/O, but write performance can depend on file sizes and access patterns.
- **Parallel Requests:** Supports massive parallelism for reads and writes, with recommended practices for managing object sizes.

#### **BigQuery:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** Supports streaming inserts for frequent writes; batches preferred for cost efficiency.
- **Caching:** Query results are automatically cached, reducing costs and improving performance for repeated queries.
- **Retention Policy:** Data retention depends on table configurations; temporary tables expire by default.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** Designed for analytics queries, optimized for high-volume data retrieval rather than frequent small writes.
- **Scaling:** Automatically scales for queries and storage but is optimized for analytical workloads, not real-time operations.
- **Parallel Requests:** Can handle high parallelism in query execution but is not ideal for frequent, small write operations.

**Recommendation:**  
For **frequent reads and writes**, **Cloud Storage with a queuing system** (e.g., Pub/Sub) is more appropriate. Use BigQuery for periodic analytics once data is stabilized.

---

### **2. Frequent Read and Less Write**
**Characteristics:**
- More read-intensive, with infrequent data updates.
- Use cases: Data lakes, dashboards, content delivery.

#### **Cloud Storage:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** No direct queuing for reads; integrates with Pub/Sub or similar systems for infrequent writes.
- **Caching:** Works well with CDN for low-latency frequent reads (e.g., serving media files or static data).
- **Retention Policy:** Configurable; suitable for archiving or long-term storage with lifecycle rules.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** High read throughput, especially when integrated with caching/CDN.
- **Scaling:** Scales automatically for large-scale reads and storage.
- **Parallel Requests:** Excellent support for parallel read operations.

#### **BigQuery:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** No direct queuing; infrequent writes through batch or streaming inserts.
- **Caching:** Query result caching and materialized views enhance performance for repetitive queries.
- **Retention Policy:** Long-term retention for structured, queryable data.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** High throughput for large, analytical queries optimized for frequent reads.
- **Scaling:** Scales query capacity automatically to handle massive parallel reads.
- **Parallel Requests:** Designed to handle high-parallelism analytical queries efficiently.

**Recommendation:**  
For **frequent reads and less writes**, **BigQuery** is ideal for structured, queryable data. For unstructured or media-rich data, **Cloud Storage** with caching (e.g., CDN) works better.

### **3. Less Read and Frequent Write**
**Characteristics:**
- High write throughput, with minimal read operations.
- Use cases: Log storage, event tracking.

#### **Cloud Storage:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** Integrates well with Pub/Sub for high write throughput.
- **Caching:** Not needed due to infrequent reads.
- **Retention Policy:** Configurable; can optimize costs for long-term storage or auto-delete temporary data.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** Supports high write bandwidth; optimized for large object uploads.
- **Scaling:** Scales seamlessly with increasing write demands.
- **Parallel Requests:** Excellent for parallel writes (e.g., batch processing).

#### **BigQuery:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** Supports streaming inserts but better suited for batch writes.
- **Caching:** Irrelevant for infrequent reads.
- **Retention Policy:** Suitable for long-term storage but may incur higher costs compared to Cloud Storage for frequent writes.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** Streaming inserts support frequent writes but are less efficient than Cloud Storage for pure write-heavy workloads.
- **Scaling:** Scales for storage and writes but incurs costs for continuous streaming.
- **Parallel Requests:** Handles parallel writes but with more overhead than Cloud Storage.

**Recommendation:**  
For **less reads and frequent writes**, **Cloud Storage** is the better option due to its cost-effectiveness and integration with streaming systems like Pub/Sub.

---

### **4. Less Read and Less Write**
**Characteristics:**
- Minimal data interaction, primarily archival or backup.
- Use cases: Cold storage, compliance data retention.

#### **Cloud Storage:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** Not needed for infrequent interactions.
- **Caching:** Not necessary for minimal reads.
- **Retention Policy:** Perfect for archival use with lifecycle rules (e.g., coldline or archive tiers).
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** Adequate for occasional access but optimized for cost-efficiency in cold storage tiers.
- **Scaling:** Scales well for large datasets, even in archival modes.
- **Parallel Requests:** Rarely a concern for infrequent operations.

#### **BigQuery:**
- **Buffering/Queuing:** Not applicable for archival use cases.
- **Caching:** Not useful for rare queries.
- **Retention Policy:** Supports long-term storage but at a higher cost compared to Cloud Storage.
- **Throughput Bandwidth:** Not optimized for infrequent or archival access patterns.
- **Scaling:** Overkill for minimal operations.
- **Parallel Requests:** Rarely relevant for infrequent data access.

**Recommendation:**  
For **less reads and less writes**, **Cloud Storage in archival tiers** (e.g., coldline or archive) is more cost-efficient than BigQuery.

# Cost requirements
- Infra cost
- Network cost

## Network cost
Read the network section in here: https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-egress
### Example
**Use case:** When the user opens my app, their file needs to be downloaded to their device. Then, while the user is using the app, I need to frequently (every few minutes) sync the user's file from the app to the cloud. So the number of uploads will be much greater than the number of downloads. Is GCS a cost-effective solution in this case? 

This is a case of inbound data transfer under general network usage. Inbound data transfer for cloud storage refers to the process of transferring data into a cloud storage system from external sources. This typically includes uploading files or data from on-premises systems, other cloud services, or end-user devices to the cloud storage service (e.g., Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage). In this scenario GCS would be just fine as inbound data transfer to GCS is free of charge.
