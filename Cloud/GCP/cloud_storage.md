# Use case problems

## Problem 1
I am currently experiencing an issue with the resolution of Cloud Storage domain from one of my servers. I have two servers hosted by different cloud providers. When resolving storage.googleapis.com on one of my servers, Google's name servers return an IP address located in Amsterdam (for example 142.250.179.187). This is unexpected because both my server and Google's datacenter are located in the US. So the request from my server goes through datacenter in Europe and back to the US resulting in a significant latency. My other server, hosted by a different provider, resolves the domain correctly (142.251.116.207) and there are no latency issues.


### **Understanding the Problem**
When your machine tries to connect to `storage.googleapis.com` (Google Cloud Storage) domain, it needs to figure out the IP address for that domain name. This process is called **DNS resolution** (Domain Name System resolution). Here's what's happening:

1. **Server 1 (Problematic Server):**
   - When Server 1 asks Google's name servers for the IP address of `storage.googleapis.com`, it is given an IP address in Amsterdam (e.g., `142.250.179.187`).
   - This is strange because your server is located in the US, and you'd expect it to connect to a nearby data center in the US if your cloud storage location is US.
   - Instead, the request goes to Amsterdam (in Europe) and then back to the US, causing high latency (a delay in data transfer).

2. **Server 2 (Working Server):**
   - Server 2 resolves `storage.googleapis.com` to an IP address in the US (e.g., `142.251.116.207`).
   - Because the data doesn’t travel far, there’s no latency issue.

The root of the problem seems to be **how Server 1 resolves the domain name**. This could be due to:
   - A misconfigured DNS resolver on Server 1. Server 1 asks the wrong DNS Server for the IP address of `storage.googleapis.com`. Or, the DNS server has the wrong IP address for `storage.googleapis.com`.
   - The DNS server used by Server 1 (e.g., your hosting provider's DNS or custom DNS settings) returning suboptimal(Too much optimization) results. Like it has returned an IP address for some other request before and cached it and suboptimally returning that IP address from the cache.

### **Why Does This Happen?**
When you ask for the IP address of a domain, your server contacts a **DNS server** to get an answer. Depending on the DNS server it uses:
- It may give you the nearest IP address of the requested domain to your server.
- Or, it may give you an IP address based on the DNS server’s own location (not your server’s location).

In this case, the DNS server used by Server 1 seems to be returning an IP address in Europe because:
- It might be configured poorly. DNS server has IP address in Amsterdam against the domain name `storage.googleapis.com`.
- It might not correctly account for your server's actual location.

### **Steps to Fix the Issue**
Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this problem:

#### **1. Check Your Server's DNS Settings**
   - DNS settings determine which DNS server your server uses to resolve domain names. Check which DNS server Server 1 is using:
     - If it's your hosting provider's default DNS, consider switching to a public DNS service like **Google Public DNS** or **Cloudflare DNS**.
   - To change the DNS settings:
     - Edit your `/etc/resolv.conf` file (Linux).
     - Add the following lines for Google Public DNS:
       ```
       nameserver 8.8.8.8
       nameserver 8.8.4.4
       ```
     - Or, for Cloudflare DNS:
       ```
       nameserver 1.1.1.1
       nameserver 1.0.0.1
       ```
     - Save the file and restart your network service.

#### **2. Flush Your DNS Cache**
   - Your server might be caching the incorrect IP address. Flushing the DNS cache will force the server to resolve the domain name again.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
     ```
   - Alternatively, restart the DNS resolver service:
     ```
     sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
     ```

#### **3. Test Domain Resolution**
   - After updating the DNS server settings, check if `storage.googleapis.com` resolves to a US-based IP address:
     ```
     nslookup storage.googleapis.com
     ```
   - Look for an IP address starting with `142.251...` (indicating a US-based data center).

#### **4. Verify Google Cloud Storage Bucket Region**
   - If you control the Google Cloud Storage bucket, confirm that it is located in the **US region**. Even though this is less likely to be the issue, mismatched bucket regions could contribute to routing inefficiencies.
   - To check or change the bucket’s region:
     - Go to the Google Cloud Console > Storage > Buckets.
     - Review the region listed for your bucket (e.g., `us-central1` or `us-east1`).

#### **5. Try From Another DNS Server**
   - If you still face issues, try running the DNS query from another server or tool to verify that the problem is isolated to Server 1:
     ```
     dig storage.googleapis.com @8.8.8.8
     ```
   - Replace `8.8.8.8` with other public DNS servers to compare results.

#### **6. Contact Your Hosting Provider**
   - If the issue persists, your hosting provider's DNS configuration might be causing the problem. Contact their support and explain the issue.

### **Preventing Similar Issues in the Future**
1. **Use Reliable DNS Services:** Public DNS providers like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) are optimized for performance and usually provide accurate results.
2. **Verify Bucket Region:** Ensure your data and servers are in geographically aligned regions.
3. **Regular Monitoring:** Periodically test domain resolution to catch and address anomalies early.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the domain correctly and reduce latency for your application. Let me know if you need further clarification!
