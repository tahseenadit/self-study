This image represents a structure of identity and account management in Google Cloud. Let me break it down into simpler terms. It shows how different types of user identities, groups, and accounts from both external sources and Google’s own services work together, especially for organizations using Google Cloud.

The diagram is split into four sections:

### 1. **External (Left section)**
   - This part represents identities and groups that are managed outside Google Cloud. 
   - Here are the key components:
     - **External Authoritative Source:** This could be a company's HR system or another identity source where user information is stored.
     - **External SAML Identity Provider:** This is an external service that uses the SAML protocol for identity verification. Companies often use this to allow employees to log into Google services with their company credentials.
     - **External Identity, External User Account, and External Group:** These represent individual user identities and groups managed outside of Google Cloud. An "external identity" could be a profile or record in an external system. An "external user account" is a user's actual login information, while "external groups" are collections of users (like departments or teams).

### 2. **Google for Organizations (Middle-left section)**
   - This area represents identity management tools and structures provided by Google for organizations.
   - Key parts here:
     - **Cloud Identity/Workspace:** This is Google’s service for managing identities for organizations. It allows companies to manage employee accounts, access controls, and permissions.
     - **Organizational Unit:** A way to group users within an organization. For example, "Marketing" or "IT" departments can be different organizational units.
     - **Managed User Account:** These are user accounts managed directly by the organization in Google’s system (often linked to employees).
     - **Group:** Groups within Google’s system allow admins to assign permissions and roles to multiple users at once.

### 3. **Google for Consumers (Middle-right section)**
   - This section represents identities that are managed by Google directly for individual consumers, not for organizations.
   - **Google Identity:** This is any user account that a consumer creates directly with Google, typically used for services like Gmail or YouTube.
   - **Consumer User Account:** This refers to individual Google accounts for consumers, often used outside of a business or organization.

### 4. **Google Cloud (Right section)**
   - This section represents Google Cloud’s organizational structure and accounts used within cloud projects.
   - Key parts here:
     - **Organization:** The highest-level entity in Google Cloud, representing the whole company or organization.
     - **Folder:** A way to organize projects under an organization, useful for managing departments or divisions within the company.
     - **Project:** A specific space where cloud resources (like virtual machines, databases, etc.) are set up and managed. Each project has its own settings and permissions.
     - **Service Account:** A special type of account for applications (not real people). It’s used to allow apps to interact with Google Cloud services securely.
     - **Kubernetes Service Account:** A service account specifically for Kubernetes (a platform for managing applications). This is useful when deploying and managing applications in the cloud with Google Kubernetes Engine.

### How They Connect
The blue lines and dashed lines in this diagram represent the different relationships or linkages between components in Google Cloud’s identity and access management ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of each one:

---

### **External Section (Leftmost Panel)**
1. **Solid Blue Line from "External Authoritative Source" to "External SAML Identity Provider"**  
   - This line shows that an external source, like an HR system or other directory, provides identity information to the SAML Identity Provider. Essentially, the identity provider uses information from this authoritative source to authenticate users.

2. **Solid Blue Line from "External Authoritative Source" to "External Identity"**  
   - This link represents that the external authoritative source also defines or provides basic identity information directly to the external identity in Google’s system.

3. **Solid Blue Line from "External Identity" to "External User Account"**  
   - This line shows that an external identity (profile or record) is used to create or manage individual user accounts in the external system.

4. **Solid Blue Line from "External User Account" to "External Group"**  
   - This line means that external user accounts are organized into groups, which could represent teams, departments, or other collections of users.

5. **Dashed Blue Line from "External SAML Identity Provider" to "Cloud Identity/Workspace Account"**  
   - This line shows that Google Cloud’s identity services (Cloud Identity or Workspace) can use an external SAML Identity Provider for logging users in. This allows users to log in to Google services using their company’s external login system.

6. **Dashed Blue Line from "External Identity" to "Managed User Account"**  
   - This shows that an external identity (a user’s profile in an external directory) can be associated with a managed user account within Google’s system. This means external users can have accounts that are managed and controlled in Google’s cloud.

7. **Dashed Blue Line from "External Group" to "Group"**  
   - This line represents that external groups (such as a group of users or a department) can be mapped to groups within Google’s system. This allows Google’s tools to recognize and manage external group memberships.

### **Google for Organizations (Middle-left Panel)**
1. **Solid Blue Line from "Cloud Identity/Workspace Account" to "Google Identity"**  
   - This line indicates that Google’s organizational accounts (in Workspace or Cloud Identity) can connect with or recognize Google Identity. Google Identity is the system that Google uses to manage user identities across all its services.

2. **Solid Blue Line from "Organizational Unit" to "Managed User Account"**  
   - This link shows that within an organization, individual managed user accounts can be grouped into organizational units (e.g., departments). Organizational units allow for specific management and policy settings for groups of users.

3. **Solid Blue Line from "Group" to "Managed User Account"**  
   - This line indicates that individual managed user accounts can be members of a group. In Google’s system, groups help manage permissions and access control for multiple users at once.

---

### **Google for Consumers (Middle-right Panel)**
1. **Dashed Blue Line from "Google Identity" to "Consumer User Account"**  
   - This line shows that Google Identity also supports individual consumer accounts (not managed by an organization). Consumers using Google services (like Gmail, YouTube) are handled through Google Identity, but these accounts are independent of organizational control.

---

### **Google Cloud (Rightmost Panel)**
1. **Solid Blue Line from "Organization" to "Folder"**  
   - This line indicates that within a Google Cloud organization, you can organize resources into folders. Folders help structure resources in a hierarchy under an organization.

2. **Solid Blue Line from "Folder" to "Project"**  
   - This shows that each folder can contain multiple projects. Projects are the basic unit in Google Cloud where resources (like virtual machines, databases) are created and managed.

3. **Solid Blue Line from "Project" to "Service Account"**  
   - This line represents that each project can have one or more service accounts. Service accounts are special accounts used by applications or services, rather than individual users, to access resources securely.

4. **Dashed Blue Line from "Service Account" to "Kubernetes Service Account"**  
   - This line represents that a regular service account in Google Cloud can be associated with a Kubernetes service account. This allows Kubernetes workloads to access Google Cloud resources securely using service account credentials.

5. **Solid Blue Line from "Google Kubernetes Engine" to "Kubernetes Service Account"**  
   - This line indicates that within Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Kubernetes service accounts are used to manage permissions for specific workloads or services running on the Kubernetes platform.
