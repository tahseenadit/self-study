In Python, attributes are simply data members of an object, while properties are methods that are accessed like attributes but actually perform some computation when called². 

Attributes are described by data variables such as name, age, height, etc. They can be either class attributes or instance attributes. Class attributes are defined in the class body parts usually at the top and are unique to each class. Each instance of the class will have this attribute. Instance attributes are defined in the class body using self keyword usually it the __init__ () method. Every object/instance has its own attribute and can be changed without affecting other instances¹.

Properties are special kind of attributes. They have getter, setter and delete methods like __get__, __set__ and __delete__ methods¹. Properties are used to add methods to class attributes and control access to them³. If you don't need additional flexibility, use attributes – they are easier to declare and faster⁴.

There is a method attribute in Python. In Python, a method is a function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an instance of that class. A method can be called on an instance of the class using the dot notation, like this:

```
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self):
        print("Hello, world!")

obj = MyClass()
obj.my_method()
```

In this example, `my_method` is a method of the `MyClass` class. We create an instance of `MyClass` called `obj`, and then we call the `my_method` method on that instance using the dot notation.

Here is an example of a property in Python that has getter, setter, and deleter methods:

```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self._name = name

    @property
    def name(self):
        return self._name

    @name.setter
    def name(self, value):
        if not isinstance(value, str):
            raise TypeError("Name must be a string")
        self._name = value

    @name.deleter
    def name(self):
        del self._name
```

In this example, we define a `Person` class with a `name` property. The `@property` decorator is used to define the getter method for the property. The `@name.setter` decorator is used to define the setter method for the property. The `@name.deleter` decorator is used to define the deleter method for the property.

The getter method simply returns the value of the `_name` attribute. The setter method checks that the value being set is a string, and then sets the `_name` attribute to that value. The deleter method deletes the `_name` attribute.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

You can set the `name` property of a `Person` instance like this:

```
person = Person(name='Alice')
person.name = 'Bob'
```

In this example, we create a new `Person` instance with the name `'Alice'`. We then set the `name` property of that instance to `'Bob'`.

Here are some examples:

```
class MyClass:
    class_attribute = 'This is a class attribute'

    def __init__(self, instance_attribute):
        self.instance_attribute = instance_attribute

obj1 = MyClass(instance_attribute='This is an instance attribute')
obj2 = MyClass(instance_attribute='This is another instance attribute')

print(MyClass.class_attribute)  # Output: This is a class attribute
print(obj1.instance_attribute)  # Output: This is an instance attribute
print(obj2.instance_attribute)  # Output: This is another instance attribute
```

In this example, we define a `MyClass` class with a `class_attribute` and an `instance_attribute`. The `class_attribute` is defined as an attribute of the class itself, while the `instance_attribute` is defined as an attribute of each instance of the class.

We then create two instances of the `MyClass` class, each with its own `instance_attribute`. We can access the `class_attribute` using the class name (`MyClass.class_attribute`) and we can access the `instance_attribute` using the instance name (`obj1.instance_attribute` or `obj2.instance_attribute`).
