# Literal

The Literal type from the typing module in Python is used to indicate that a variable should only accept certain literal values. It allows you to restrict the possible values of a variable to a specific set of literal constants.

In Python .pyi files, the ellipsis (...) is used as a placeholder to indicate that the implementation of the function or method is not provided in the type hint file. It's a way to define the signature of a function or method without specifying its actual implementation.
