Suppose you have created a python virtual environmnet using: `python -m venv .venv` And then you have activated it using: `source .venv\bin\activate` . So now you are inside the virtual environment.

But you can see if the python in your virtual environment is just a symlink that is pointing to another python in your system:

`ls -l $(which python3.11)`

The output can look like:

`lrwxr-xr-x  1 tahseen  somedir\Domain Users  65 16 Oct 00:04 /Users/tahseen/optimizedsklearn/.venv/bin/python3.11 -> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11`

From the output it can be seen that the python in my virtual environment is just a symbolic version of the system python. 

If you execute `ls -l /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11` then you will see an output like below:

```
total 27776
lrwxrwxr-x   1 root  admin        18 15 Jun  2023 Headers -> include/python3.11

drwxrwxr-x   4 root  admin       128  7 Jun  2023 share
```

As you can see above, bin is not pointing to any other python installation. So, it is not a symlink. 

So, even if you have PATH like `PATH=/Users/mdana/optimizedsklearn/.venv/bin:/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin` in your `Ã¨nv`, some program might still be redirected to  `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11` instead of `/Users/tahseen/optimizedsklearn/.venv/bin/python3.11`. Or you may need to explicitely tell some program to get or find some file from `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11` instead of `/Users/tahseen/optimizedsklearn/.venv/bin/python3.11`. For example, the include directory of `/Users/tahseen/optimizedsklearn/.venv/bin/python3.11` is empty and it gets the files from the include directory of `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11`. So, any program that needs a header file from the include directory might be pointed to `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11` from `/Users/tahseen/optimizedsklearn/.venv/bin/python3.11` since it is pointing to 
`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11`.
