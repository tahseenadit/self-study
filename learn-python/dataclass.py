Understanding Dataclasses in Python

dataclasses is a module in Python that provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding special methods such as __init__() and __repr__() to 
user-defined classes. It is used to create classes that are primarily used to store data. This is often useful for classes that are intended to be simple 
structures without much custom behavior.

### Understanding `dataclasses.asdict()`

In Python, the `dataclasses` module provides a function called `asdict()` which is used to convert a dataclass instance into a dictionary. 
Here's what happens during this process:

1. **Conversion to Dictionary**: 
   - `asdict()` takes an instance of a dataclass (like `metrics_context`) and iterates over its fields (attributes that were defined in the dataclass).
   - For each field, it creates a key-value pair in the dictionary: the field's name becomes the key, and the field's value becomes the value in the dictionary.

2. **Handling of Nested Dataclasses**:
   - If any of the fields are themselves dataclasses, `asdict()` will also convert these nested dataclasses to dictionaries recursively.

3. **Exclusion of Methods**:
   - Only fields (attributes that are data) are included in the resulting dictionary. Methods (functions defined within the dataclass) are not included 
     in the dictionary. This is because `asdict()` is designed to work with data, not behaviors (methods).

4. **Treatment of Variables**:
   - Variables that are part of the dataclass (i.e., those declared in the class scope) are converted to dictionary entries.
   - Any instance or class variables not defined as fields of the dataclass (i.e., added to an instance after its creation or defined outside of the 
     dataclass fields) are not included in the dictionary.

### Example with `MetricsContext`

"""
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass
class MetricsContext:
    player_id: str
    deployment: str
    deployment_id: str
    project_id: str

"""
The MetricsContext Dataclass

In your code, MetricsContext is defined as a dataclass. This means that Python will automatically add an __init__() method to it. Hereâ€™s what each part means:

@dataclasses.dataclass: This is a decorator that tells Python to make this class a dataclass.

class MetricsContext:: This defines a new class named MetricsContext.

The class contains variables like player_id, deployment, etc. These are fields of the class, and an instance of MetricsContext will store values for each 
field.

"""

# When you create an instance of `MetricsContext` and use `dataclasses.asdict()`:


metrics_context = MetricsContext(player_id="123", deployment="test", deployment_id="456", project_id="789")
metrics_dict = dataclasses.asdict(metrics_context)

"""
This results in:

```python
metrics_dict = {
    "player_id": "123",
    "deployment": "test",
    "deployment_id": "456",
    "project_id": "789"
}
```

In this dictionary, each key corresponds to a field name of `MetricsContext`, and each value corresponds to the value of that field in the `metrics_context` 
instance.

### Summary

In summary, `dataclasses.asdict()` is a convenient way to convert the data stored in a dataclass instance into a dictionary, which can then be easily 
manipulated, iterated over, or used in various other contexts where a dictionary format is more suitable than an object instance. Methods and non-field 
variables are not included in this conversion.
