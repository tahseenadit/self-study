Imagine a scenario where we have two players: the local coffee shop owner and the coffee chain. Each player has two possible strategies:

1. Local coffee shop owner:
   - Defend the big shop.
   - Defend the small shop.

2. Coffee chain:
   - Attempt to take over the big shop.
   - Attempt to take over the small shop.

Now, let's analyze the payoffs (values) associated with each possible outcome. According to the provided table, we can see that the big shop is worth three times as much as the small shop.

Here are the payoffs for the coffee chain:

- If the coffee chain attempts to take over the big shop and succeeds, the payoff is +3.
- If the coffee chain attempts to take over the small shop and succeeds, the payoff is +1.
- If the coffee chain attempts to take over a shop defended by the local coffee shop owner, the payoff is 0.

And for the local coffee shop owner:

- If the local coffee shop owner successfully defends the big shop, the payoff is +3.
- If the local coffee shop owner successfully defends the small shop, the payoff is +1.
- If the local coffee shop owner's shop is taken over by the coffee chain, the payoff is 0.

Given these payoffs, we can construct a payoff matrix that shows the outcomes for each combination of strategies chosen by the two players.

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & \text{Defend Big Shop} & \text{Defend Small Shop} \\
\hline
\text{Attack Big Shop} & 0,0 & 3,1 \\
\hline
\text{Attack Small Shop} & 1,3 & 1,1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, let's analyze the situation:

- If the coffee chain always aims to take over the big shop, the local coffee shop owner can easily predict this strategy and will always defend the big shop. As a result, the coffee chain will never succeed in taking over the big shop and will end up with a payoff of 0 most of the time.
- Conversely, if the coffee chain always aims to take over the small shop, the local coffee shop owner will likely prioritize defending the big shop, assuming it's their most valuable asset. As a result, the coffee chain will have a higher chance of succeeding in taking over the small shop and gaining a payoff of +1.

Therefore, the optimal strategy for the coffee chain is to adopt a mixed strategy, where they attempt to take over the big shop most of the time (to prevent being too predictable) but also aim to take over the small shop occasionally to maximize their overall payoff.

This application of mixed strategies in game theory highlights how players can achieve better outcomes by introducing randomness into their decision-making, thereby making it harder for their opponents to predict their actions.
