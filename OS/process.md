You can use various tools to check which Python processes are running and whether your `main.py` or FastAPI server is active. Here are some common ways to do that:

### 1. **Using the `ps` Command (Linux/macOS)**

You can use the `ps` command in combination with `grep` to filter Python processes. Open your terminal and run:
```bash
ps aux | grep python
```
Explanation:
- `ps aux` lists all the running processes.
- `grep python` filters to show only those processes related to Python.

This will display a list of all Python processes currently running, including information like the process ID (PID), CPU usage, and the command used to start them. You should see entries for both your `main.py` and FastAPI server.

To narrow it down further, you can search specifically for your script or FastAPI server:
```bash
ps aux | grep main.py
ps aux | grep uvicorn
```

### 2. **Using `pgrep`**

`pgrep` is a more convenient command to directly find processes by name:
```bash
pgrep -fl python
```
Explanation:
- `-f` searches for the full command line of each process.
- `-l` shows the name of the process.

This will list all Python-related processes, including your `main.py` and FastAPI server, with their respective PIDs.

### 3. **Using `top` or `htop`**

You can use tools like `top` or `htop` to get a dynamic view of running processes:
- **top**: In the terminal, type `top` and press `Enter`. To filter by Python processes, press `/` and type `python`.
- **htop** (if installed): Type `htop` and press `Enter`. Then, you can easily search by pressing `/` and entering `python`.

`htop` is more user-friendly and provides a color-coded view of CPU and memory usage. You can see all active processes and easily identify those related to Python.

### 4. **Using Windows Task Manager or Command Prompt (Windows)**

If you're using Windows, you can check running Python processes in two ways:

- **Task Manager**: Open the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc), go to the "Details" tab, and look for `python.exe` entries. These will include both your `main.py` and FastAPI server if they are running.
  
- **Command Prompt**: Run the following command in the command prompt:
  ```cmd
  tasklist /fi "imagename eq python.exe"
  ```
  This will list all Python processes currently running on your machine.

### 5. **Using Python's `psutil` Library**

If you want to do it programmatically from within Python, you can use the `psutil` library. First, install it:
```bash
pip install psutil
```

Then, you can use the following code snippet to list all Python processes:
```python
import psutil

for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
    if 'python' in proc.info['name']:
        print(proc.info)
```

This code will output detailed information about each Python process running on your system, including its PID, name, and command line arguments.

### Summary

- **Linux/macOS**: Use `ps aux | grep python` or `pgrep -fl python`.
- **Windows**: Use Task Manager or `tasklist /fi "imagename eq python.exe"`.
- **All systems**: Use `top` or `htop` for real-time monitoring.
- **Python script**: Use the `psutil` library for programmatic checking.

To use tools like `top`, `ps aux | grep python`, or `psutil`, you typically open a **new terminal window or tab** while your Python program is running in a separate terminal. This way, you can monitor the active processes without interrupting your main script or FastAPI server.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open a Terminal for Your Program**:
   - Start by opening one terminal window and run your main Python program that starts the FastAPI server, e.g.:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Open Another Terminal for Monitoring**:
   - Open a **new terminal window or tab** to check the active processes. This allows you to keep your main program running without interference.
   - Now you can use the following commands to monitor your processes:

   **Option 1: Using `ps aux | grep python`**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep python
   ```
   This will show all running Python processes, including your `main.py` and FastAPI server if they are active.

   **Option 2: Using `top`**
   - In the terminal, type:
     ```bash
     top
     ```
   - Press `/` and then type `python` to filter the processes and only show those related to Python.
   - This will update in real-time and show you the resource usage of your Python processes.

   **Option 3: Using `htop` (if installed)**
   - If you have `htop` installed, type:
     ```bash
     htop
     ```
   - Then, press `/` and enter `python` to filter for Python processes.

3. **Using `psutil` Programmatically (Python Code)**
   - Open a new terminal and run a Python script using the code below to see the list of running Python processes:
     ```python
     import psutil

     for proc in psutil.process_iter(['pid', 'name', 'cmdline']):
         if 'python' in proc.info['name']:
             print(proc.info)
     ```
   - This script will output details of all running Python processes without affecting your main program.

### Why Open a New Terminal?

Opening a new terminal ensures that you don't interrupt the execution of your `main.py` file or FastAPI server. Monitoring tools like `top`, `htop`, and commands like `ps` do not interfere with the running processesâ€”they only provide a view of the system's state.

So, yes, always use a separate terminal window or tab to run these monitoring commands while your main program runs in its own terminal.

The `ps aux` command lists all running processes on the system, but it doesn't directly indicate which process is the current **foreground process**. However, there are a few ways to identify the foreground process using other commands or terminal information.

### Methods to Find the Foreground Process

1. **Use the `jobs` Command** (For Shell Sessions)
   - If you're running processes directly in your terminal, you can use:
     ```bash
     jobs
     ```
   - This command lists all the processes started from your current shell session. It indicates if a job is running in the foreground (`+`) or if it's in the background (`&`). The foreground job typically doesn't have an ampersand (`&`) symbol next to it.

2. **Use `fg` Command** (For Job Control)
   - If you have background processes and want to bring one to the foreground, you can use:
     ```bash
     fg
     ```
   - This command brings the most recent job to the foreground. If you have multiple jobs, you can specify which job to bring to the foreground using the job ID, like `fg %1`.

3. **Check the TTY Field in `ps` Output**
   - The `TTY` column in the `ps aux` output indicates the terminal or console associated with each process.
   - Processes running in the **foreground** are associated with the current terminal (e.g., `tty1`, `pts/0`, `pts/1`, etc.).
   - To filter processes by the current terminal, you can run:
     ```bash
     ps -t $(tty)
     ```
   - This command shows only the processes running in your current terminal session, making it easier to spot the foreground process.

4. **Use `top` or `htop`**
   - `top` or `htop` provide dynamic, real-time views of all running processes.
   - They show processes sorted by CPU usage, and you can easily spot active processes that are consuming resources.
   - To quickly identify the foreground process in your terminal, press `c` while using `top` or `htop` to see the full command line, which can help you match the running command.

### Understanding Foreground vs. Background

- **Foreground Process**: A process that is directly interacting with your terminal and is receiving user input.
- **Background Process**: A process running in the background without direct user interaction. You usually start these with an ampersand (`&`) at the end of the command.

### Example

Let's say you have a process running called `python main.py`:
1. Run `jobs` to see if `python main.py` is listed as a job in your shell session.
2. Use `ps -t $(tty)` to see processes associated with your current terminal, which should include `python main.py` if it's running in the foreground.

These methods should help you identify which process is currently running in the foreground of your terminal.

# Example scenario of ps aux
The output of the command `ps aux | grep python` is showing you a list of all processes that are related to Python or have the word "python" in them. Let's break down each part of the output so you can understand what it means.

### Understanding the Output

The typical columns in the output of `ps aux` are:
1. **USER**: The username of the person who started the process.
2. **PID**: The Process ID, a unique identifier for the running process.
3. **%CPU**: The percentage of CPU usage by this process.
4. **%MEM**: The percentage of memory usage by this process.
5. **VSZ**: Virtual memory size (in kilobytes).
6. **RSS**: Resident Set Size, the non-swapped physical memory used by the process (in kilobytes).
7. **TTY**: The terminal associated with the process.
8. **STAT**: The current status of the process (e.g., S=sleeping, R=running, Z=zombie).
9. **START**: The time when the process started.
10. **TIME**: The total CPU time used by the process.
11. **COMMAND**: The command used to start the process and its arguments.

### Breaking Down Your Output

Let's go through each of the lines from your output:

1. **First Line**
   ```
   mdana            26847   0.0  0.0 34252344    748 s001  S+   10:52pm   0:00.00 grep python
   ```
   - **USER**: `mdana`
   - **PID**: `26847`
   - **COMMAND**: `grep python`

   This line is actually the process that you just ran to search for "python" processes (`grep python`). It shows that the `grep` command itself is running in the background looking for Python processes.

2. **Second Line**
   ```
   mdana            25670   0.0  0.3 73538192 107784   ??  S    10:44pm   0:01.06 /private/var/folders/0_/tv152k2n7d9d2rkfl0t731jh1bbc4m/T/AppTranslocation/AA6054C0-1A3B-48DC-8960-CCBEC1277BEF/d/Visual Studio Code 2.app/Contents/Frameworks/Code Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Code Helper --ms-enable-electron-run-as-node /Users/mdana/.vscode/extensions/ms-python.vscode-pylance-2023.1.10/dist/server.bundle.js --cancellationReceive=file:3359c9d9e20d36c885c55dad08272c659ad1f10d97 --node-ipc --clientProcessId=25619
   ```
   - **USER**: `mdana`
   - **PID**: `25670`
   - **COMMAND**: `/private/var/.../Code Helper ... server.bundle.js`

   This line indicates that a process related to Visual Studio Code is running. Specifically, it is the Pylance language server, which is a part of the Python extension in Visual Studio Code. It helps provide features like code analysis, completion, and linting for Python code.

3. **Third Line**
   ```
   mdana            25668   0.0  1.1 46040208 364888   ??

   ```
   - **USER**: `mdana`
   - **PID**: `25668`
   - **COMMAND**: `/Users/mdana/.vscode/... sonarlint-ls.jar ... sonarsecrets.jar`

   This process is associated with the SonarLint extension for Visual Studio Code, which is a static analysis tool that checks for issues in code, including Python code. This particular line shows that it is running a Java process to handle the analysis.

### What This Means

- **No FastAPI Server Detected**: Based on the output, there is no evidence of a FastAPI server running directly as a Python process. If your FastAPI server is running, you should see a line with `uvicorn` or `python` followed by the name of your FastAPI application.
- **Other Processes**: Most of the processes you see are related to Visual Studio Code and its extensions, specifically Pylance (Python language server) and SonarLint.

### What to Do Next

1. **Ensure FastAPI is Running**: Make sure that your FastAPI server is actually started in the terminal. If you don't see a Python process related to FastAPI, it might not have started properly.

2. **Look for `uvicorn` or `python` Processes**: If you started your FastAPI server using `uvicorn` or directly with Python, you should look for processes with those keywords. For example:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep uvicorn
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep main.py  # If main.py is your FastAPI file
   ```

3. **Restart the FastAPI Server if Necessary**: If you don't see the FastAPI process, you might need to restart it and check the process list again.

This should help you confirm whether the FastAPI server is running or not. Let me know if you need more assistance!

### Same file opened in multiple processes:

Let's assume we have the same file opened in VSCode and Cursor. The behavior is not related to the processes of VSCode and Cursor, but rather to how both editors are watching the same file on your filesystem.

When we have the same file opened in both VSCode and Cursor:
1. Both editors are separate processes
2. Both editors implement file watchers that monitor changes to files in their workspace
3. When we modify the file in one editor, the change is saved to the filesystem
4. The other editor's file watcher detects the change and updates its view accordingly

This is similar to how if we opened the same text file in Notepad and WordPad - they're different processes, but they're both looking at the same file on disk. When one saves changes, the other will detect the file modification and usually prompt us to reload or automatically reload the file.

In technical terms:
- Each editor (VSCode and Cursor) runs as its own separate process
- They both use file system watchers (like `fs.watch` in Node.js or similar APIs) to monitor file changes
- The editors are not directly linked to each other, they're just both watching the same file
- The filesystem acts as the shared resource that both processes monitor

This is why we see the updates propagate between editors - it's not because they're the same process or linked processes, but because they're both watching and responding to changes in the same file on disk.
